# Big Data Cloud Service- CE and Event Hub Workshop using Demo Central

Demo Central – powered by Oracle Global Solution Engineering (GSE) - offers a MetCS (Metered Cloud Service) Stack of preconfigured cloud services in the Oracle Public Cloud for Solutions Engineers to use for workshops, demonstrations and proof of concepts.
As of the date of this publication, a GSE engineer must manually configure a demo environment that has all cloud services necessary to run Big Data Journeys

This guide is intended to help Oracle Solution Engineers set up an Oracle Big Data Cloud Service – Compute Edition environment in Demo Central so they may run through the Big Data Journeys available for clients and prospects

# Steps
- Register a Demo with Demo Central
- Launch the Demo Environment
- Customize Your Dashboard to Display Additional Services
