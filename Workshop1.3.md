### **STEP 3**: Launch the Big Data Cluster Console

- Launch the Big Data Cluster Console for your BDCS-CE cluster.  If this is your first time, you will likely need to allow your browser to accept the self-signed certificate for the web console application.
- You will be asked to provide a username/password.  Use the username and password you defined earlier when you created the BDCS-CE instance (the username defaults to bdcsce_admin).  If you are an Oracle Employee/Partner using a GSE "deal server" pre-provisioned environment, the un/pw will be set to bdcsce_admin/Welcome321
